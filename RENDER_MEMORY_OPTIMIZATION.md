# MEMORY OPTIMIZATION FOR RENDER DEPLOYMENT

## Current Issues

The Auto ANI website was experiencing memory-related build failures on Render:

1. **JavaScript Heap Out of Memory Error**: Occurs during build process
2. **Prisma OpenSSL Compatibility Warning**: Using outdated OpenSSL 1.0.x libraries

## Optimized Build System

We've implemented a comprehensive solution to address these issues:

### 1. Memory Optimizations

- Increased Node.js memory allocation to 3072MB
- Disabled TypeScript type checking during build
- Disabled linting during build
- Optimized Next.js build configuration
- Created custom build scripts with extreme memory optimization

### 2. Prisma Compatibility Fixes

- Created a script to update Prisma libraries for OpenSSL 3.x compatibility
- Added automated fix during deployment

## New Deployment Files

We've added several new scripts to optimize the build process:

1. **`scripts/render-deploy.sh`**: Main deployment script used by Render
2. **`scripts/extreme-build.sh`**: Extremely optimized build for limited memory
3. **`scripts/fix-prisma-openssl.sh`**: Fixes Prisma OpenSSL compatibility

## Render Configuration

The `render.yaml` file has been updated to use our optimized build process:

```yaml
buildCommand: bash scripts/render-deploy.sh
```

This script handles:
- Installing dependencies with memory optimizations
- Fixing Prisma OpenSSL compatibility
- Generating Prisma client with optimized settings
- Building the Next.js application with minimal memory usage

## Usage Instructions

### Running Optimized Build Locally

```bash
npm run build:extreme
```

### Fixing Prisma OpenSSL Issues

```bash
npm run prisma:fix-openssl
```

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the next deployment for memory usage
2. Consider upgrading to a higher tier Render plan if needed
3. Implement proper code splitting to reduce bundle size
4. Remove unused dependencies
